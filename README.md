# RTM-simulation
This folder contains the R script, the data and some information concerning an Risk Terrain Modelling simulation for the city of Paris. It is part of the evaluation for "Data and Algorithms for Public Policy" at Sciences Po.

Most of its functioning is inspired by "[Public Policy Analytics: Code & Context for Data Science in Government]([url](https://urbanspatial.github.io/PublicPolicyAnalytics/))" by Ken Steif, Ph.D. The material in this repository is authored by Giovanni Cerboni.

This instrument is a toy model aimed at understanding how real like Risk Terrain Models function, in the context of an investigation on one used by the Metropolitan Police of London. The modelling is statistically inconclusive, due to constraints in the data publicly available on criminality in France, but is a useful pedagogical tool. 

None of the conclusions on distribution of crime and risk in the city present should be taken for anything more than speculative.
